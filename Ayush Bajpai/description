A NFC enabled COVID testing kit.

Description-
So how does a COVID testing kit works?
Well,here we will be taking the use of IgM/IgG Rapid Test Kits,it takes sample of your blood through a needle just like when you go
for a sugar test,and then this tiny drop of blood is mixed with a solution in a bottle which is already present their in the kit.
Later this solution of blood and chemical is pored into a testing slab which almost looks like a pregnancy testing slab.Now within
minutes it shows the result,if the lines appear to be red,tyhen the patient 
is positive else he/she is negative.

Ways to host-
We just need to connect the app via NFC to the testing kit and all data will be transfered to the app,later we can use the app data 
to see who is positive and who is not,we can use HttpsUrlConnection to fetch data or any other method.
